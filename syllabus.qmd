## Course Description

This course aims to develop programming skills in R, a powerful statistical programming language. This course assumes some prior familiarity with R and ranges from advanced beginner topics to intermediate topics. It will cover practical data science skills in R that are useful for a career in statistics, epidemiology, or data science, including loading data, data wrangling, visualization, automation, machine learning, and running statistical models. A laptop is required for class to participate in coding exercises.


## Credit Hours

3 credit hours. 

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understand** and **utilize** **R/RStudio**, including using **Quarto** to create **reproducible** documents of statistical analyses.
2. **Understand** basic data types and data structures in R.
3. **Familiarize** and **load** data files (Excel, Comma Separated Value files) into R/Rstudio, with tips on formatting.
4. **Visualize** datasets using **ggplot2** and understand how to build basic plots using **ggplot2** syntax.
5. **Filter** and **format** data in R for use with various routines.
6. **Run** and **Interpret** some basic statistics in R.
7. **Automate** repetitive tasks in R, such as loading a folder of files.

## Attendance 

* This class will meet in-person and you are expected to attend class regularly. However, we understand that it is not always possible to attend class and daily attendance will not be monitored. 
* Classes will be recorded, but we cannot guarantee the in-person format will lend itself to effective recordings. If you miss class, please reach out to a classmate for missed material.

### Post-class surveys

* 5% of your grade is based on filling out [post-class surveys](https://ohsu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5urkrdktEwkQqEu) as a way of telling us that you came to class and engaged with the material for that week.
* You only need to fill out 5 surveys (of the 10 class sessions) for the full 5%. We encourage you to fill out as many surveys as possible to provide feedback on the class though.
* __Please fill out surveys by 8 pm on Sunday evenings to guarantee that they will be counted.__ We usually download them some time on Sunday evening or Monday. If you turn it in before we download the responses, it will get counted. 
* The questions on the survey are:
    * Rating the pace of the lecture and lab
    * Clearest Point: *What point of the class was clearest for you?*
    * Muddiest Point: *What point of class was the muddiest (unclear) for you?*
    * Anything Else: *Anything else you'd like me to know?*


## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly using Quarto in RStudio. It will be due via Sakai upload Wednesdays at 11:55pm the night of the following week's class (unless otherwise noted). Please turn in *both your .qmd and rendered .html file.*

The homework with the lowest score will be dropped from your homework average. 

### Late Policy

Students get 1 free homework assignment to submit late within 3 days without penalties. *Please email the instructors and the TA that you need more time.* If you need an accommodation, please email us so we can figure out a way to help you.



## Function of the Week

Please choose a function from the Function of the Week sign-up sheet (link will be posted on [Sakai](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-526-1-AX-W24/tool/a973f2a2-ea06-4734-aab7-a066c5573ca6/)). A Quarto template to format your Function of the Week and presentation will be provided. Function of the Week presentations will start in week 4. On the sign-up sheet you will choose a week to present your function to the class, as well as the function. The presentation should be short, around 5 minutes. If presenting to the class feels prohibitive, you may submit a 5-10 minute screen recording with your voice narrating the presentation, and this will be distributed to the class. 

Previous years' Functions of the Week can be found on the previous class websites:

* <https://sph-r-programming-2023.netlify.app/functions/>
* <https://sph-r-programming-2022.netlify.app/functions/>
- <https://sph-r-programming.netlify.app/functions/> (2021)

We will create a similar website for this year's Functions of the Week. *If you do not wish yours to be on the public facing website, just let us know. Alternatively, we can also post it anonymously.* See submitted Functions of the Week for this quarter at this [link](function_week.qmd).


## Midterm and Final Projects

* Midterm and final projects/tests will be take home. 
    * The midterm will be a project based on a dataset of your choosing.      
    * The final will be based on an assigned dataset. 
* Previous years' midterms can be found on the class websites:
    - <https://sph-r-programming-2023-midterms.netlify.app/>

In assigning points 0-10, the following general guidelines will be applied:

|       |                                                 |
|:-----:|-------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Exceeds the standard                            |
| **B** | Meets the standard                              |
| **C** | Key gaps in understanding of the standard       |
| **D** | Unable to demonstrate B or C without assistance |
| **F** | No evidence                                     |

## Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the BioData Club Code of Conduct:
<https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/>

And as students of an OHSU course, we must abide by the OHSU Code of Conduct: <https://www.ohsu.edu/integrity-department/code-conduct>

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions. We want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

*There is a link on Sakai to a form to anonymously report to us any possible code of conduct violations, based on the OHSU Code of Conduct or the OHSU Biodata Code of Conduct.* 


## Required Texts and Readings

We will be drawing on the following online textbooks during class and labs. These books are online and free, though you can order them as textbooks if you prefer that format.

+ **R for Data Science**. Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. 2nd Edition. <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>
+ **Getting Used to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown**. Chester Ismay.
<https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/>
+ **Data Science: A First Introduction**. Tiffany Timbers, Trevor Campbell, Melissa Lee. <https://datasciencebook.ca/>
+ **RMarkdown for Scientists**. Nick Tierney. <https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/>
+ **Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse**. Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim. <https://moderndive.com/>
+ **Advanced R**. Hadley Wickham. <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/>
+ **Quarto** webpage <https://quarto.org/>
    + The [Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and [Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/) tabs have very helpful documentation.
    

### Note on RMarkdown vs. Quarto

* We will be using the newer Quarto instead of RMarkdown for creating reproducible documents. Some of the links above are for RMarkdown, which is very similar. 
    * The main differences are in setting up the yaml and code chunk options.
    * Many of the RMarkdown code chunk options work with Quarto though. 
    * With Quarto you will see a `Render` button instead of a `Knit` button to create the html output of the file. 

## Words of Encouragement

> This was adopted from Andrew Heiss. Thanks!

I *promise* you can succeed in this class.

Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): 

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail us, etc.

## LeaRning is Social

Students who struggle in courses often are ones who don't work with each other to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.

If you understand something and know someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with. 

Our goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There's no such thing as a perfect programmer. We've been learning new things almost every day.


## Copyright Information

Every reasonable effort has been made to protect the copyright requirements of materials used in this course. Class participants are warned not to copy, audio, or videotape in violation of copyright laws.

Journal articles will be kept on reserve at the library or online for student access. Copyright law does allow for making one personal copy of each article from the original article. This limit also applies to electronic sources.

To comply with the fair use fair use doctrine of the US copyright law, Sakai course sites close three weeks after grades are posted with the Registrar. Please be sure to download all course material you wish to keep before this time as you will have no further access to your courses.

## School of Public Health Handbook

All students are responsible for following the policies and expectations outlined in the student handbook for their program of study. Students are responsible for their own academic work and are expected to have read and practice principles of academic honesty, as presented in the handbook: <https://ohsu-psu-sph.org/current-graduate-students/policies-procedures/#academic-dishonesty>.

## Syllabus Changes and Retention

This syllabus is not to be considered a contract between the student and the School of Public Health. It is recognized that changes may be made as the need arises. Students are responsible for keeping a copy of the course syllabus for their records.

Syllabi are considered to be a learning agreement between students and the faculty of record. Information contained in syllabi, other than the minimum requirements, may be subject to change as deemed appropriate by the faculty of record in concurrence with the academic program and the Office of the Provost. Refer to the [Course Syllabi Policy, 02-50-050](https://o2.ohsu.edu/policies-and-compliance/ohsu-policy-manual/chapter-2-student-affairs/ohsu-policy-02-50-050.cfm).


## Syllabus Statement Regarding Disability Services

OHSU is committed to providing equal access to qualified students who experience a disability in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990, and the ADA Amendments Act (ADA-AA) of 2008. If you have a disability or think you may have a disability (physical, sensory, chronic health, psychological or learning) please contact the Office for Student Access at (503) 494-0082 or <studentaccess@ohsu.edu> to discuss
eligibility for academic accommodations. Information is also available at [www.ohsu.edu/student-access.](http://www.ohsu.edu/student-access) Because accommodations may take time to implement and cannot be applied retroactively, it is important to have this discussion as soon as
possible. All information regarding a student's disability is kept in accordance with relevant state and federal laws.

Please see Student Access & Accomodations section for more details on the Sakai version of this Syllabus.


## Commitment of Equity and Inclusion

## Academic Honesty

* Course participants are expected to maintain academic honesty in their course work. Participants should refrain from seeking past published solutions to any assignments. Literature and resources (including
internet resources and generative AI) employed in fulfilling assignments must be cited. 
    * See [Purdue University's Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/avoiding_plagiarism/index.html) for resources on plagiarism and importantly avoiding plagiarism (thanks to [Steve Bedrick](https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/bmi525/policies.html) for this link!).
    * Assignments suspected of plagiarism (including copying past solutions or another student's assignment) will receive 0 points for the assignment and the dean of the student's academic program will be notified. 
* In an effort to uphold the principles and practice of academic honesty,
faculty members at OHSU may use originality checking systems such as
Turnitin to compare a student's submitted work against multiple
sources.
    * To protect student privacy in this process, it will be necessary to
remove all personal information, i.e. student name, email address,
student u-number, or any other personal information, from documents
BEFORE submission.*

### Use of ChatGPT or other generative AI for assignments

ChatGPT and other generative AI tools can be great resources for learning how to code and/or troubleshoot code that does not work. However, the work you turn in must be your own. Thus it is inappropriate to directly ask AI to provide you with solutions to homework questions or write text that you are submitting in your assignment. 
If you do use AI tools to help you with an assignment, these must be cited along with how they were used. 

Please see the Plagiarism & Attribution section (Code Snippets and AI Tools subsection) of Dr. Steve Bedrick's [BMI 525: Principles and Practice of DataVisualization](https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/bmi525/policies.html) webpage for examples of appropriate and inappropriate uses generative AI.
