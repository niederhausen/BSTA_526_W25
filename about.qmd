### Quarto webpage 

* Thank you to [Nicky Wakim](https://github.com/nwakim/) for creating her amazing webpage for [BSTA 550](https://nwakim.github.io/F2023_BSTA_550/), and sharing her code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nwakim/F2023_BSTA_550). Having her template made creating this website a much smoother process.
* Thank you also to [Andrew Bray](https://andrewpbray.github.io/) for presenting the [From R Markdown to Quarto](https://andrew.quarto.pub/oregon-asa/) ASA Travelling Workshop to the Oregon Chapter of the ASA in June 2023. This workshop was a great starting point in making the switch from RMarkdown to Quarto and also create Quarto webpages.
