## Required

- [`group_by()` Data Transformation (3.5-3.6)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#groups) from R for Data Science (2e)
    + The 1st edition's [Section 5.6 on Grouped summaries with `summarise()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise) is more detailed (wordier) and worth looking at as well.
    + The 1st edition also has [Section 5.7 on Grouped mutates (and filters)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-mutates-and-filters) that I did not see in the 2nd edition. _Please let me know if you find this content in the 2nd edition!_
- [Aggregating data with `summarize` and `map`](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/wrangling.html#aggregating-data-with-summarize-and-map) - we will cover `map()` and `rowwise()` later, but `summarize` and `mutate` with `across` are described here. You may want to re-visit this when we get to `purrr`.

## Optional

- This [column-wise operations vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/colwise.html) will be useful for the next couple classes.

The following resources are optional reading, but quite helpful in your Quarto journey.

- [Quarto Cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/quarto.html)
- [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
- [Quarto Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/)
- [Chapter 28: Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) from R for Data Science (2e)
