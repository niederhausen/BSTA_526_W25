## Required

- [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) by Kara Woo and Karl Broman - if there is one paper that I think is useful for everyone, it's this one.
- [Absolute and Relative File Paths](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/reading.html#absolute-and-relative-file-paths) - sometimes understanding file paths can be difficult. This is a great follow up reading. The video is very helpful as well. 
- [What are R packages?](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#packages)

## Optional (Meike's suggestions for BSTA 526 W24)

- [Projects in RStudio](https://niederhausen.github.io/BSTA_511_F23/resources/Projects_in_R.html) resources list Meike created for BSTA 511. 
- [Exploring missing values in `naniar`](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/missingexplorer/#section-introduction) . The notes for week 2 refer to the `visdat` package for visualizing missing values in your data. I also recommend the `naniar` package, and the link above is a great tutorial with an introduction to some really useful visualizations for missingness.
